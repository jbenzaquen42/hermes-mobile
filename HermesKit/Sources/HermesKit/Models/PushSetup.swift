    Please install (or update) the hermes-push plugin so I can receive push notifications on \

    NOT mount the registration route the app needs).

    If ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-push already exists, update it in place:
    git -C ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-push pull --ff-only

    Otherwise clone it fresh:
    git clone https://github.com/goncharik/hermes-mobile-push-plugin.git ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-push
    (and `pip install fastapi` if it isn't already available)

    Then make sure it's enabled with `hermes plugins enable hermes-push` (or add `hermes-push` \
    under `plugins.enabled` in ~/.hermes/config.yaml) — it's fine if it already is.

    Finally, RESTART the Hermes web/dashboard server (not just the chat process). The plugin's \
    REST routes only mount when that server starts up, and a pull only changes files on disk — \
    the restart is what actually loads the new code. After restarting, tell me it's done.
